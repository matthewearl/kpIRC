h1. IRC Client

h2. Introduction

Small IRC client I wrote a while back (around 2005). Features coloured text (via a custom control) and command auto-completion.

h2. Building and running

Build with:

<pre>ant build</pre>

Run with:

<pre>ant IrcClient</pre>

h2. Settings

Settings can be changed by editing Settings.xml in the root of the repository. The schema is reasonably self-explanatory.
